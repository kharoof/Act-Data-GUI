# Act-Data-GUI
Create a GUI for importing Transactional/Observational Data into a R data structure

This GUI will be focused on Actuarial Users. One of the hurdles to implementing R for new users 
is the learning curve associated with R data structures. This project is inspired by projects such as 
rattle which make loading data for analysis extremely straightforward for users with little prior knowledge of R. The user with the domain knowledge no longer needs to be an expert in R and can instead focus on the analysis.

This project is intended to provide a package that focuses on loading data, displaying it and manipulating it. This is intended to complement further packages that later provide cutting edge analysis techniques.
