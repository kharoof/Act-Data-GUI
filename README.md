# Act-Data-GUI
A GUI for importing Transactional/Observational Data into an R data structure

This GUI will be aimed at Actuarial Users. One of the hurdles to implementing R for new users 
is the learning curve associated with R data structures. This project is inspired by projects such as 
rattle which make loading data for analysis extremely straightforward for users with little prior knowledge of R.
The user with the domain knowledge no longer needs to be an expert in R and can instead focus on the analysis.

This project is intended to provide a package that loads data from csv files. Further packages will displays it and manipulates it.
These group of programs are intended to complement other packages that provide cutting edge analysis techniques and visulisations.
