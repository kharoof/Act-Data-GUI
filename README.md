# Act-Data-GUI
Create a GUI for importing Transactional/Observational Data into a R data structure
####################################################################################

This GUI will be focused on Actuarial Users. One of the hurdles to implementing R for new users 
is the learning curve associated with R data structures. This project is inspired by projects such as 
rattle which make loading data for analysis extremely straightforward for users with little prior knowledge of R.
